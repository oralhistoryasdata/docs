### Notes when I asked what was misssing

(had Claude build an advanced section to start )

Looking at the overall documentation structure, I see several areas that could still use updates or
  additional pages to create a more complete user experience:

  1. Missing Visualization Documentation
    - There's limited information about how the visualization system works
    - Users would benefit from a dedicated page on how to interpret and use the visualizations
    - Consider adding a "Using Visualizations" page in the Coding & Analysis section
  2. No Troubleshooting Guide
    - Common issues and solutions aren't documented
    - A "Troubleshooting" page would help users resolve problems independently
    - Could cover issues like build failures, display problems, and metadata errors
  3. Limited Advanced Topics
    - More experienced users might want to customize beyond the basics
    - Consider an "Advanced Customization" page covering themes, layouts, and JavaScript modifications
    - Information on extending the functionality would be valuable
  4. Minimal Examples of Complete Projects
    - Walking through a complete example from start to finish would be helpful
    - A "Sample Project Walkthrough" could demonstrate the entire workflow with a real example
  5. Accessibility & Best Practices
    - Guidance on creating accessible oral histories
    - Best practices for metadata, transcription, and tagging
    - Ethical considerations when publishing interviews
  6. Migration & Integration
    - How to migrate from other platforms
    - Integrating OHD with other digital humanities tools
    - Using the CollectionBuilder connection effectively
  7. Collaborative Workflows
    - More detailed guidance on team-based projects
    - Version control strategies for multiple contributors
    - Permission and access management
  8. Managing Larger Collections
    - Scaling advice for projects with many interviews
    - Performance considerations
    - Organization strategies for extensive metadata

  A logical final section might be "Advanced Topics" that could include several of these pages. This
  would provide growth paths for users as they become more experienced with the platform.
