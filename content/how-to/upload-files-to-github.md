3. **Name your file**
   - Type the filename in the field at the top
   - Include the proper extension (e.g., `.csv`, `.md`)
   - For transcripts, type `transcripts/filename.csv` to create in the transcripts subfolder

4. **Add your content**

## Important Tips for OHD Files

### Metadata File

- Upload to the `_data` directory
- Filename should match what's in your `_config.yml` (typically `metadata.csv`)
- Ensure it has all required fields (objectid, title, display_template)

### Transcript Files

- Upload to the `_data/transcripts` directory
- Filenames must match the objectid values in your metadata
- Example: If objectid is "smith_john", filename must be "smith_john.csv"

### Creating the Transcripts Folder

If the `transcripts` folder doesn't exist yet:

1. Click "Add file" â†’ "Create new file"
2. Type "transcripts/placeholder.csv" in the name field
3. Add some sample content
4. Commit the file to create the folder
5. You can delete this placeholder file later

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **File too large** | GitHub has a 100MB file size limit; consider external hosting for large media |
| **Upload failing** | Try uploading fewer files at once |
| **CSV displaying incorrectly** | Verify your CSV format; avoid Excel and use Google Sheets or plain text editors |
| **Transcripts not showing on site** | Check that filenames exactly match objectids in metadata |

## Next Steps

After uploading your files:

1. [Configure your site](edit-github-files) if you haven't already
2. [Publish your site](../tutorials/tutorial-publishing) to make it accessible online
3. [Test your site](../tutorials/tutorial-publishing#common-issues-and-solutions) to ensure everything works correctly
