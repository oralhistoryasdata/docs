title: How OHD Works
---

OHD uses a CSV-driven approach to manage your collection. Rather than creating individual web pages for each interview, you'll manage all your interviews through a simple spreadsheet and let the system automatically generate the web presentation.

## The Complete Workflow

**1. Prepare Your Environment**
- Create a copy of the OHD GitHub Repository
- Configure your project settings

**2. Prepare Your Interviews**
- Transform interview transcripts into structured CSV files
- Add metadata through a spreadsheet (based on [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/csv_metadata/))

**3. Develop Your Analysis Framework**
- Create a controlled vocabulary for coding
- Apply thematic codes to your transcript content

**4. Publish and Share**
- Publish your collection using GitHub Pages
- Connect transcripts with audio/video sources (optional)

**5. Analyze and Visualize**
- Explore your collection through interactive visualizations
- Identify patterns across multiple interviews

The entire process is designed to be flexible, allowing you to focus on the content and analysis rather than web development. Whether you're working with a single interview or a large collection, OHD scales to meet your needs.

At the end of the process, you'll have a professional-quality website that publishes your transcripts with powerful search, browse, and visualization features. The final product will enable both your research and public engagement with your interviews.

### About Oral History as Data

Oral History as Data was first built in 2018, coming out of work at the University of Idaho Library's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CD?L)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). 
The framework served as the foundation for several digital humanities projects, including [Voices of Gay Rodeo](https://www.voicesofgayrodeo.com/), [Idaho Queered](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/queered/), and [CTRL+Shift](https://ctrl-shift.org/). 

The project is closely related to the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) project, and the current iteration was built on top of a CollectionBuilder-GH template.
