# Publishing and Connecting Media

After preparing your transcripts and metadata, you're ready to publish your content and optionally connect it with audio and video sources. This section walks you through uploading your materials and enhancing them with multimedia elements.

## What You'll Learn

- How to add content to your GitHub repository
- How to connect transcripts with audio/video recordings
- How to ensure everything displays properly on your site

## The Publishing Workflow

1. **Upload content** - Add your transcripts and metadata to the repository
2. **Connect media** - Link transcripts to audio/video sources (optional)
3. **Verify display** - Check that everything appears correctly on your site

## Why This Matters

Publishing is the final step in making your oral histories accessible to the public. By connecting interviews with their original audio or video recordings, you create:

- A more engaging user experience
- Multiple ways to interact with your content
- Greater accessibility for different learning styles
- A more complete historical record

### CollectionBuilder Connection

Oral History as Data is built on the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) framework and uses the [CollectionBuilder-CSV metadata format](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/csv_metadata/). This means:

- Your projects follow digital library metadata standards
- You can repurpose your metadata for other CollectionBuilder projects
- Your oral history collection integrates with other digital collection tools
- You're building on a well-established, open-source platform
