# Preparing Your Interview Transcripts

This section guides you through the process of transforming traditional interview transcripts into structured CSV files that can be used with the Oral History as Data platform. Properly formatted transcripts are essential for searchability and visualization.

## What You'll Learn

- How to convert existing transcripts to the required CSV format
- How to properly structure speaker segments and dialogue
- How to clean and prepare text for web display
- How to add timestamps for audio/video synchronization

## The Transcript Workflow

1. **Clean your transcript text** - Remove formatting artifacts and normalize text
2. **Create the CSV structure** - Format with required columns: speaker, words, tags, timestamp
3. **Separate by speaker** - Ensure each row represents a single speaker's segment
4. **Add timestamps** - Link text to corresponding media points (optional)

## Why This Matters

Structured transcript data enables core OHD functionality:

- Improved readability with speaker identification
- Interactive searching within interview content
- Media synchronization for audio/video connections
- Foundation for thematic coding and analysis
- Consistent display across different browsers and devices
