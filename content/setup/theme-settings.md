# Customizing Your Site with `_data/theme.yml`

The `_data/theme.yml` file controls your site's appearance and many display options. Use it to adjust colors, layout, and which features are visible to users.

## Key Options in `theme.yml`

### Transcript Page Options
```yaml
transcript-fields: "description,date,location,interviewer,image"
```
Controls which metadata fields appear at the top of each transcript page. Choose from: `description`, `date`, `location`, `interviewer`, `interviewee`, `bio`, `image`. List the fields you want displayed, separated by commas.

```yaml
media-scroll: true
```
Keeps the media player and visualization visible as you scroll (on large screens with minimum width 1024px). The media appears in the lower right as users scroll down a transcript.

```yaml
search-and-filters: true
search-and-filters-sticky: true
```
The first option shows the search/filter bar above transcript text. The second option makes the search and filter controls stick to the top of the page as users scroll down.

### Visualization Page Options
```yaml
as-data: true
```
Shows an "As Data" button at the top right of the visualization page, which opens a modal with more information about the data when clicked.

```yaml
transcript-contents: true
```
Displays and filters the contents of individual interviews at the bottom of the visualization page (below the color-coded chart portion).

```yaml
json-generation: false
```
**Warning for Large Collections**: If set to `true`, you must run the rake command `generate_json` to create necessary JSON files. This determines whether JSON files are accessed for advanced visualization features. Defaults to `false`.

### Site Layout Options
```yaml
base-layout: OHD
```
Choose between `OHD` or `CB` (CollectionBuilder) to control the overall site appearance and styling.
