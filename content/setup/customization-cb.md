# Customizing Using CollectionBuilder Options

Because it is built on top of CollectionBuilder, you have a large number of ways to update your site using CollectionBuilder options. 

CollectionBuilder has extensive documentation covering its customization options. Here's an overview of options: 

# CollectionBuilder Documentation Guide

## Theme Options
The `_data/theme.yml` file controls display options that impact every page of your site. These settings affect global options in your website, so it's important to review each one as you create your site.

- [Theme Options Overview](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/theme/) - Main page explaining theme configuration
- [Home Page Configuration](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/theme/home/) - Configure your collection's home page features, including featured images and banner settings
- [Browse Page Configuration](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/theme/browse/) - Options for the browse layout
- [Item Page Configuration](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/theme/item/) - Settings for individual item pages
- [Navbar Configuration](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/theme/navbar/) - Custom navbar options

## Page Config
CollectionBuilder's navigation features and visualization pages are configured via "config" CSV files located in your project's "_data" directory. These config files usually have the prefix "config-" and tend to be more detailed than the options in "theme.yml".

- [Metadata Configuration](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/config/metadata/) - Configure how metadata fields display

## Edit Pages
Most pages in CollectionBuilder are placeholders for visualization features like "Browse" or "Subjects," but you'll want to edit "about.md" and potentially add more interpretive pages.
