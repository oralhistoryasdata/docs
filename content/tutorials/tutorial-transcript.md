- 30-45 minutes of time (less for subsequent transcripts)

## Tutorial Steps

   - Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)
   - Click "Blank" to create a new spreadsheet

### Step 2: Clean Your Transcript Text

1. **Open your transcript document**
   - Open your interview transcript in Word, Google Docs, or another program
   - Select all text (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)

2. **Use the text cleaner tool**
   - Paste your text in the top box below
   - Click the "Clean Text" button
   - The cleaned version will appear in the bottom box

   {% include wordcleaner.html %}

   - Select all text (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A) 
   - Copy it (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)

### Step 3: Structure Your Transcript

2. **Separate text by paragraph**
   - If your text appears in a single cell, follow these steps:
     - Select the cell with your text
     - Click Data → Split text to columns
     - In the separator options, choose "Custom" and enter a paragraph mark (usually \n)
     - Click "Split"
   - Each paragraph should now be in its own row

3. **Identify speakers**
   - In column A, add the speaker name for each segment of text
   - For example:
     - "Interviewer" for questions
     - "John Smith" for the interviewee's responses
   - Be consistent with names throughout

### Step 4: Add Optional Information

1. **Add timestamps** (if you have audio/video)
   - In column D, add timestamps for key segments
   - Format as MM:SS (e.g., 01:45) or HH:MM:SS (e.g., 1:12:30)
   - Match to the corresponding points in your recording

2. **Add topic tags** (for visualization)
   - In column C, add relevant topic keywords
   - Use semicolons between multiple tags (e.g., "education; family; career")
   - Be consistent with terminology across segments

### Step 5: Finalize and Save

1. **Review your spreadsheet**
   - Ensure each row has a speaker identified
   - Check that text is properly separated (one speaker segment per row)
   - Verify any timestamps or tags are correctly formatted

2. **Save as CSV file**
   - Click File → Download → Comma-separated values (.csv)
   - Name your file to match the objectid in your metadata
   - Example: If your interview has objectid "smith_john" in metadata, name the file "smith_john.csv"

3. **Upload to your repository**
   - Place the CSV file in the _data/transcripts/ folder
   - For GitHub users:
     - Navigate to the _data/transcripts/ folder in your repository
     - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
     - Drag your CSV file or use the file selector
     - Commit the changes
