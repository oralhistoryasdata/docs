# Tutorial: Publishing Your Site with GitHub Pages

This step-by-step tutorial shows you how to make your Oral History as Data collection publicly accessible on the web using GitHub Pages, GitHub's free hosting service.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- A shareable URL that anyone can visit
- Automatic updates whenever you modify your content

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have:
- A GitHub repository created from the OHD template
- Your metadata and transcript files uploaded
- Basic configuration completed in _config.yml

## Step-by-Step Publishing Process

### Step 1: Access Repository Settings

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub**
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to your repository URL (https://github.com/your-username/your-repository)
   - Make sure you're logged in

2. **Click the "Settings" tab**
   - Find the top menu bar with options like "Code," "Issues," etc.
   - Click "Settings" (usually the rightmost option)

### Step 3: Wait for Your Site to Build

1. **Monitor the build process**
   - After committing, GitHub will start building your site
   - This typically takes 2-5 minutes for the first build
   - You can see the progress by clicking on the "Actions" tab

2. **Check deployment status**
   - A green checkmark will appear when the build succeeds
   - Your site will be deployed to: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

### Step 4: Access and Share Your Site

1. **Visit your published site**
   - Use the URL format: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`
   - For example: `https://jsmith.github.io/my-oral-history/`
   - If you see a 404 error, wait a few more minutes and try again

2. **Add the URL to your repository info**
   - Return to your repository's main page
   - Look for the "About" section on the right sidebar
   - Click the gear icon
   - Paste your site URL in the "Website" field
   - Click "Save"

## Making Updates to Your Published Site

Whenever you make changes to your repository:

1. **Edit files** directly on GitHub or push changes from your computer
2. **GitHub Actions** automatically rebuilds your site
3. **Changes appear** on your site within a few minutes

This automatic process makes it easy to maintain and update your collection over time.

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **404 error when visiting site** | Wait 5-10 minutes; first build takes longer |
| **Build fails** | Check Actions tab for error details; often a YAML formatting issue |
| **Missing images or files** | Ensure paths are correct and files are in the repository |
| **Transcripts don't display** | Verify objectid in metadata matches transcript filename |
| **Slow loading** | Optimize image sizes; use external services for media files |

## What's Next?

Now that your site is published:

1. **Share your collection** with your audience
2. **Test thoroughly** on different devices and browsers
3. **Consider enhancements** like:
   - [Adding Google Analytics](../setup/configuration.html#analytics)
   - [Customizing the theme](../customize/customization.html)
   - [Adding more interviews](../prepare-metadata/tutorial-metadata.html)
