## Real-World Examples

The techniques covered in the documentation have been applied in several successful projects:

### CTRL+Shift
[CTRL+Shift](https://ctrl-shift.org/) was one of the first OHD implementations, focusing on interviews with poets about their use of computers in their writing processes. Though using an earlier codebase, it demonstrates the core visualization capabilities.

### Taylor Wilderness Research Station Oral Histories
[Taylor Wilderness Research Station Oral Histories](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/taylor-archive/oral_histories/) demonstrates how OHD can be embedded within a larger digital collection, showing its flexibility as a component in more extensive digital humanities projects.
