# Managing Large Collections

As your oral history project grows, you may face challenges with organization, performance, and workflow. This guide provides strategies for effectively managing larger collections of interviews within Oral History as Data.

## Planning for Scale

### Collection Architecture

Before adding numerous interviews, consider your collection's structure:

1. **Single Repository vs. Multiple Repositories**
   - Single: Simpler management, unified search
   - Multiple: Better performance, more flexible categorization
   - Recommendation: Consider splitting after ~30-50 interviews

2. **Organizational Schemes**
   - Chronological: Arrange by interview date
   - Thematic: Group by research themes
   - Project-based: Separate distinct research initiatives
   - Regional: Organize by geographic focus

### GitHub Pages Considerations

GitHub Pages has limitations to consider:

1. **Repository Size Limits**
   - 1GB repository size limit
   - 100GB bandwidth per month
   - Build time increases with repository size

2. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - Store media files externally
   - Use Git LFS for large files (with caution)
   - Implement pagination for large collections

## Technical Optimization

### Performance Optimization

Large collections require attention to performance:

1. **Transcript Optimization**
   - Split very long transcripts into logical segments
   - Optimize CSV structure for faster parsing
   - Consider pre-processing transcripts to remove unnecessary content

2. **JavaScript Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for transcript content
   - Add pagination to visualization interfaces
   - Use browser caching effectively

   ```javascript
   // Example of transcript segment lazy loading
   document.querySelectorAll('.load-more-button').forEach(button => {
     button.addEventListener('click', async function() {
       const segmentId = this.dataset.segment;
       const response = await fetch(`/data/segments/${segmentId}.json`);
       const data = await response.json();
       // Append segment content
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Search Optimization**
   - Implement faceted search for large collections
   - Create specialized indexes for different content types
   - Consider server-side search for very large collections

### Storage Strategies

1. **Audio/Video Management**
   - Use external platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud)
   - Implement streaming media solutions
   - Consider institutional repositories for archival quality media

2. **Multi-tiered Storage**
   - GitHub Pages: Site code, transcript text, metadata
   - Media Platforms: Interview recordings
   - Institutional Storage: High-resolution masters, raw files

## Workflow Considerations

### Batch Processing

For adding multiple interviews efficiently:

1. **CSV Generation Tools**
   - Create custom scripts for batch transcript processing
   - Use spreadsheet templates with validation
   - Implement quality control checks

   ```python
   # Example Python script for batch processing transcripts
   import csv
   import os
   import re
   
   def process_transcripts(directory):
       for filename in os.listdir(directory):
           if filename.endswith('.txt'):
               # Convert to CSV format
               with open(os.path.join(directory, filename), 'r') as f:
                   text = f.read()
               
               # Process and save as CSV
               object_id = filename.replace('.txt', '')
               process_transcript(text, object_id)
   
   # Additional processing functions...
   ```

2. **Metadata Management**
   - Maintain a master metadata spreadsheet
   - Implement version control for metadata
   - Consider database-backed solutions for very large collections

### Team Management

For projects with multiple contributors:

1. **Editorial Workflows**
   - Establish clear roles and permissions
   - Create contributor guidelines
   - Implement quality control checkpoints

2. **Git Workflow Strategies**
   - Use feature branches for new interviews
   - Implement pull request reviews
   - Consider GitHub Actions for validation

## Case Studies

### Voices of Gay Rodeo

The [Voices of Gay Rodeo](https://www.voicesofgayrodeo.com/) project manages a substantial collection by:

- Organizing interviews by theme and year
- Using consistent naming conventions
- Implementing custom navigation for different user pathways
- Separating media assets from transcript data

### Strategies from Institutional Collections

Larger institutional oral history collections often employ these approaches:

1. **Hierarchical Organization**
   - Organize by collection, series, and item
   - Create landing pages for sub-collections
   - Implement breadcrumb navigation

2. **Specialized Access Points**
   - Create topic guides across collections
   - Generate timelines for chronological access
   - Build relationship maps between interviews

## Future-Proofing

### Migration Paths

Plan for potential future growth:

1. **From GitHub Pages to Server Solutions**
   - Pathways to Jekyll-based server hosting
   - Transition strategies to other platforms
   - Data export tools and formats

2. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Separate visualization tools from content hosting
   - Create modular elements that can be reused
   - Document APIs and data structures

### Preservation Considerations

Ensuring long-term access:

1. **Data Formats**
   - Store master files in preservation-friendly formats
   - Create data dictionaries and documentation
   - Implement standard metadata schemas (Dublin Core, PBCore)

2. **Institutional Partnerships**
   - Collaborate with library/archive institutions
   - Establish deposit agreements for long-term preservation
   - Create succession plans for project sustainability
