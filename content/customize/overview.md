# Customizing Your Site

After preparing your transcripts and metadata, you can enhance your project with customizations and visualization options. This section covers how to code your transcripts for analysis and how to configure the visual aspects of your site.

## What You'll Learn

- How to create and apply a consistent coding vocabulary to transcripts
- How to customize the appearance and functionality of your site
- How to configure the visualization features for transcript analysis

## The Customization Workflow

1. **Set up your coding vocabulary** - Create a controlled vocabulary in filters.csv
2. **Apply codes to transcripts** - Tag transcript segments with relevant topics
3. **Configure site appearance** - Adjust colors, layout, and other visual elements
4. **Test visualization features** - Verify that coded transcripts display properly

## Why This Matters

Proper coding and customization transform your transcripts from simple text into interactive, analyzable data. This approach allows:

- Visual pattern identification across multiple interviews
- Thematic analysis through interactive filtering
- Improved user experience through intentional design
- More engaging presentation of your oral history content
